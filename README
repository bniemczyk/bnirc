you can put any commands in your ~/.bnirc file, they will be auto-executed on startup
check sample.bnirc for an example

run /help to get a list of commands that the client knows
LOTS MORE that aren't listed work, but are only passed to the server, but i'm not gonna list them

RFC compliance:
by default the IRC RFC are broken in a few non-dangerous ways to deal with stupid clients, particularly with regards to NOTICE verse PRIVMSG, care has been taken to avoid "bot-chatter" when in this mode, if you want you can go to strict compliance with /set strict_rfc on
