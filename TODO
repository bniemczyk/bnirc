before 1.0.0:
finish dcc plugin
clean up all warnings
add option to put /msg's in a new window
figure out why window resizes add junk chars to the input window
add emacs-like line editing... goddammit i hate emacs, you whiners ;p 
[ a more elegant solution to the emacs editing would be to use readline() somehow, but i think it's gonna take some massive hacking ]
fix "double space" when a newline is the first char to be moved to next line
