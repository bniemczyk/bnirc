This is for package bnIRC Maintainers.

General Notes
------------------------------------
The prereqs for bnIRC are python and ncurses, binary packages 
should use ncursesw for UTF support.  Much of the work
for rpm and deb packages has been automated and can be done
with a simple 'make rpm' or 'make deb' - please see format
specific notes below.

All binary packages should include the python and io_ncurses
plugins.  This means you have to ensure that the -devel
packages are installed before you build or else it will build
without them and you won't get an error message.

Getting the Correct Source for a Version
--------------------------------------------------------
bnirc is developed using git.  A "master" version is hosted on 
github. If you are familiar with git you can clone
git://github.com/bniemczyk/bnirc.git then checkout the branch
for the corresponding version ie:
    git clone git://github.com/bniemczyk/bnirc.git
    cd bnirc
    git branch --track 1.1.1 origin/1.1.1
    git checkout 1.1.1

For those of you that do not want to learn git and prefer
tarballs you can download tarballs or zips from
http://github.com/bniemczyk/bnirc/tree/1.1.1
replacing 1.1.1 with the correct version

Publishing your Package
---------------------------------------------------------
name your package with the following name scheme:
bnirc-VERSION-RELEASE(OPTIONAL)-DISTRO-ARCH

ex:
bnirc-1.1.1-Etch-x86_64.deb
bnirc-1.1.1-CentOS-i386.rpm

You can send it to brandon.niemczyk@gmail.com or if you are
a regular contributer and want direct sf.net access, talk to
brandon on irc or email him.

RPM Packages
------------------------------------
In order to build rpm packages you have to setup your
environment a little bit first, but this should be a one
time ordeal.

First you need to create a .rpmmacros file in your home
directory: vim ~/.rpmmacros

Here is what mine looks like (without the #########):
################## begin rpmmacros file ##################
%packager Brandon Niemczyk <brandon.niemczyk@gmail.com>
%vendor BnIRC

%_topdir /home/brandon/rpm
################# end rpmmacros file #####################

now we need to make sure that %_topdir exists (in my case
it is /home/brandon/rpm) along with some subdirectories:

$ mkdir -p /home/brandon/rpm
$ cd /home/brandon/rpm
$ mkdir -p RPMS/i386 SRPMS BUILD SOURCES SPECS

now we can build the package:
$ cd <bnirc directory>
$ yum install ncurses-devel python-devel
$ ./configure
$ make rpm

the rpm will now be in /home/brandon/rpm/RPMS

DEB Packages
---------------------------------------
You'll need a fairly recent version of debhelper (>= 0.7).
This is so that the same debian control files can be used
for debian and ubuntu.  If you are using debian etch, you'll
need to install debhelper from debian backports. 
http://www.backports.org/

MAKE sure that the parent directory to bnirc is writeable
because that is where dpkg-buildpackage puts the built
package files

edit debian/changelog and set the author/maintainer for
the current release to yourself instead of brandon.niemczyk

$ apt-get install libncursesw5-dev python2.5-dev
$ ./configure
$ make deb

you should now have a .deb and all the debianized sources in 
the parent directory
