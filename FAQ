How come when i join channels they are all in the same window?
irssi has the annoying habit of opening you a new window everytime you join a channel
this can be extremely irritating if you chill in 20 rooms that are mostly idle, so in bnirc you have
to manually switch the window by pressing F{1-12} or with /win {1-12}, if you want to open 3 channels in sep windows
in your ~/.bnirc do this:

/win 1
/j #channel1
/win 2
/j #some_other_loser_channel
/win 3
/j #blar

when i connect, nothing happens!
you probably didn't 'make install', almost all of bnirc's functionallity is in plugins and it looks for these
in ${PREFIX}/lib/bnirc/plugins
moral of the story:  'make install' _then_ run, and if you still have problems, you can bitch at me ;p

does bnirc have DCC capabilities?
not yet, but it will soon, that is my current project, you can check the status by loading the dcc plugin (/load dcc)
if it doesn't give you a warning, it's done ;p

how do i load a plugin?
/load <plugin name>

how do i leave a msg for an idle user
/queue <nick> your message

how do i save my msgs that i get when i'm gone and check them later?
/away
/back

how do i send someone a private message?
/msg <nick> message

how do i switch channels?
/join <channel> (if you are already in it, it will just become your "active" channel)

how do i use a backup name in my .bnirc?
just put /nick <backup> before your preferred name, like
/nick brandon|second
/nick brandon

where can i get help?
/connect irc.freenode.net
/nick lostnewb
/join #justlinux

when i connect it just keeps reconnecting?
you probably forgot to /nick after your connect

where can i get a sample .bnirc file
sample.bnirc should have come with your distribution

how do i change my window in my .bnirc file?
/win {1-12} or
/window {1-12}

i read about command <x> for irc, but it doesnt show up in /help !
only commands that bnirc actually parses locally will show up in help
if it does not recognize a command, it will blindly pass it to the server
as is (without the / though of course).  So it should work.
